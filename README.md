# Thought Dump Application

## What will the application do?

**This application is designed to be a place where you can "thought dump"**,
where you can write down anything that is on your mind. You can rant about whatever
is happening in your life, take little notes about the good or bad things that occurred during the day, or even
just taking a simple note to Google something later when you have the chance. It's meant to be a place where you can
write absolutely anything you want without worrying about odd privacy conflicts that might occur when saving something
to the cloud.

With each thought you write down, you can **associate an emoji** with it to represent how you're feeling when writing it.
You can also choose to either **save it to a folder that you've named or throw it in the virtual trash** when you just want
to get something off of your chest.

## Who will use the application?

The target audience for Thought Dump is **students, particularly those who have a hard time collecting and dealing with
their thoughts and emotions**. However, I want to make the UI of this application intuitive enough for anyone to use.

## Why does this project interest me?

This project actually "solves" a problem of mine. I've recently started thought dumping in a new email, where all my
thoughts are just drafts that will never be sent as actual emails. However, I don't like using the interface of Gmail
to write down all my thoughts, and it feels a little weird having an email solely for the purpose of making drafts.
